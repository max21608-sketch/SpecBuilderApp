// What the model is allowed to return, and what we insist on before believing
// any of it.
//
// ============================================================================
// THE OUTPUT IS DELIBERATELY DUMB.
//
// The model returns OBSERVATIONS — "this document, on page 14, says SX11A's leg
// finish is Antique Brass" — and nothing else. It never returns a spec record
// id, a requirement id, or an answer state.
//
// Two reasons, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   1. Resolving a ref to a record is not a language problem. `SX11A` appears
//      TWICE in the pilot BOQ with different quantities. A model asked to pick
//      one will pick one, confidently, and be right half the time. Code that
//      finds two candidates reports two candidates and makes a human choose.
//   2. An answer state is an operational decision. `confirmed` versus `tbc` is
//      the difference between a gate passing and a gate blocking. A document
//      that literally says "TBC" must never produce a settled answer, and that
//      rule belongs in tested code, not in a prompt.
//
// So: the model reads; the resolver in spec-document.ts decides; a human
// confirms. Each of those three can be wrong in a way the next one catches.
//
// The tool schema and the Zod schema look redundant. They are not. The tool
// schema is a REQUEST — it shapes what the model tries to produce. Zod is the
// CHECK, applied to what actually arrived. A model can return malformed output
// under any schema, and TypeScript types are not runtime validation.
// ============================================================================
